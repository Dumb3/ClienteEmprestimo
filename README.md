Create a Prediction Algorithm to see what is the ideal costumer for Loan
In this code I`ve tried to predict what is the pattern of a ideal costumer of a Bank.
For this i use a Bank dataset that says when someone was accepted for loan and when they are not accepted,
and more then that, how much money that person have, if that person have a credit card or not and others important information 
to better understand what is important for the Bank and also why this costumer want this loan.
To solve this problem I`ve used the Python language and the libraries Pandas,Numpy,Matplotlib 
and for the prediction i choosed the Decision Tree and Random Forest algorithms.
